# AIASF: AI Attack Surface Framework (AIASF)
AI Attack Surface Framework (AIASF) presents a simple model for considering the attack surface of GenAI/LLM applications. Maps to OWASP Top 10 for LLMs and also highlights some crossover with MITRE ATLAS.

## Introduction

AIASF is a framework designed to identify and mitigate security risks associated with Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It serves as a guide for developers and security professionals to understand potential vulnerabilities to better allow for implementation of effective defenses.

## Features

- Detailed analysis of attack vectors
- Mapping to MITRE ATLAS and OWASP LLM Top 10
- Practical mitigation strategies (TBD)
- Alignment with security frameworks (TBD)
- Contribution guidelines for community collaboration

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
